rhino (1.6.R5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Wolfgang Baer from Uploaders and added myself.
  * Fixed FTBFS: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused.
    Was trying to download xmlbeans Jar, which is not allowed. As
    this Jar is not (yet) in Debian, rhino has been built with XML
    implementation disabled.
    A bug in 1.6.R5-2 meant that it was still trying to download the
    "treetable" source. This has been fixed in debian/rules by copying the
    sample source code into the "downloaded" directory (the sample source code
    had to be modified).
    (Closes: #424466)
  * Moved "-doc" package to doc section.
